//weight and has its own implementation of  calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price calculated as following: 
//if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20% discount.
//The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own implementation of calculateSalePrice(): 
//if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
